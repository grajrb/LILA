# Temporary Local Development Fix

## Option 1: Start Local Nakama Server

1. In your LILA project, run:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d
   ```

2. Use ngrok to expose it publicly:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 7350
   ```

3. Update Vercel environment variables with the ngrok URL:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_NAKAMA_HOST = your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io
   NEXT_PUBLIC_NAKAMA_PORT = 443
   NEXT_PUBLIC_NAKAMA_USE_SSL = true
   ```

## Option 2: Fix Railway Deployment

Check your Railway dashboard and ensure:
- Nakama service is deployed and running
- Environment variables are set correctly
- The correct URL is being used

## Current Issue
Your `lila-backend.up.railway.app` is not responding as a Nakama server.
You need to either fix the Railway deployment or use an alternative.
