# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the Nakama server authentication failure where the client application receives 401 Unauthorized errors when attempting to authenticate with the Nakama server. The issue occurs during the device authentication phase before WebSocket connections are established.

## Glossary

- **Nakama_Client**: The JavaScript client library that communicates with the Nakama server
- **Authentication_Manager**: The component responsible for handling device authentication with proper server keys
- **Server_Key_Validator**: The system that ensures server keys match between client and server configurations
- **Environment_Synchronizer**: The component that synchronizes environment variables between Railway backend and Vercel frontend

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to successfully authenticate with the backend server, so that I can access real-time multiplayer features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Nakama_Client attempts device authentication, THE Authentication_Manager SHALL use the correct server key
2. THE Server_Key_Validator SHALL verify that client and server keys match before authentication attempts
3. THE Nakama_Client SHALL receive successful authentication responses from the server
4. WHERE authentication fails, THE Authentication_Manager SHALL provide specific error details
5. THE Environment_Synchronizer SHALL ensure server keys are consistent between Railway and Vercel deployments

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear visibility into authentication configuration, so that I can quickly identify and fix server key mismatches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Authentication_Manager SHALL log server key validation attempts with masked key values
2. WHEN server keys mismatch, THE Server_Key_Validator SHALL provide specific error messages indicating the mismatch
3. THE Environment_Synchronizer SHALL validate that required environment variables are present
4. IF server key is missing or invalid, THEN THE Authentication_Manager SHALL prevent authentication attempts
5. THE Nakama_Client SHALL display configuration status during connection attempts

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated server key synchronization, so that deployments maintain consistent authentication configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Environment_Synchronizer SHALL detect when server keys are out of sync between environments
2. WHEN deploying to production, THE Server_Key_Validator SHALL verify key consistency before allowing connections
3. THE Authentication_Manager SHALL support fallback authentication strategies for development environments
4. WHERE server keys are updated, THE Environment_Synchronizer SHALL provide guidance for updating all environments
5. THE Nakama_Client SHALL gracefully handle server key rotation scenarios
