    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.3_

  - [ ] 3.2 Add Mixed Content Policy violation detection

    - Create detectMixedContentViolation method to identify security errors
    - Add error pattern matching for Mixed Content Policy messages
    - Implement automatic protocol upgrade when violations are detected
    - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.3_

  - [ ] 3.3 Write unit tests for Connection Security Handler
    - Test Mixed Content Policy violation detection
    - Test protocol upgrade functionality
    - Test security validation logic
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 4. Enhance environment configuration

  - [ ] 4.1 Update environment variable handling

    - Modify nakama.ts to better handle Railway.app specific configuration
    - Add logic to detect Railway deployment and adjust port/host accordingly
    - Implement configuration validation with helpful error messages
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

  - [ ] 4.2 Create EnvironmentConfig utility class

    - Write EnvironmentConfig class to centralize configuration logic
    - Add methods to detect production vs development environments
    - Implement shouldForceSSL method based on deployment context
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.5_

  - [ ] 4.3 Write configuration tests
    - Test environment detection logic
    - Test Railway.app specific configuration handling
    - Test configuration validation and fallbacks
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [ ] 5. Implement comprehensive error handling

  - [ ] 5.1 Add error classification and user feedback

    - Update page.tsx to handle WebSocket connection errors gracefully
    - Add specific error messages for Mixed Content Policy violations
    - Implement connection status indicators with retry options
    - _Requirements: 3.3, 3.5_

  - [ ] 5.2 Create connection monitoring and logging

    - Add detailed logging for connection attempts and failures
    - Implement connection status tracking with timestamps
    - Create debug information display for development environment
    - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.4_

  - [ ] 5.3 Write integration tests for error handling
    - Test error classification and user feedback
    - Test connection monitoring and status tracking
    - Test recovery mechanisms for different error types
    - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.3_

- [ ] 6. Update client application integration

  - [ ] 6.1 Integrate WebSocketManager into main application

    - Replace direct Nakama client usage with WebSocketManager in page.tsx
    - Update authentication flow to use secure WebSocket creation
    - Add connection status monitoring to the UI
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.5, 3.3_

  - [ ] 6.2 Add user-friendly error boundaries and status indicators

    - Create error boundary component for WebSocket connection failures
    - Add visual indicators for connection status (connecting, connected, failed)
    - Implement retry buttons and connection troubleshooting tips
    - _Requirements: 1.5, 3.3, 3.5_

  - [ ] 6.3 Write end-to-end tests for WebSocket integration
    - Test complete WebSocket connection flow with security handling
    - Test error recovery and user feedback mechanisms
    - Test connection status indicators and retry functionality
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.3_
