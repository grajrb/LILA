# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the WebSocket connection security issue where the client application fails to connect to the backend due to Mixed Content Policy violations when attempting insecure WebSocket connections from an HTTPS page.

## Glossary

- **Client_Application**: The Next.js frontend application located in the client directory
- **WebSocket_Manager**: The component responsible for establishing and maintaining WebSocket connections
- **Connection_Security_Handler**: The system that ensures all connections use appropriate security protocols
- **Environment_Config**: The configuration system that manages connection URLs based on deployment environment

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to connect securely to the backend, so that I can use real-time features without security warnings or connection failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Client_Application is served over HTTPS, THE WebSocket_Manager SHALL use WSS protocol for all connections
2. THE Connection_Security_Handler SHALL automatically detect the page protocol and select appropriate WebSocket protocol
3. THE Environment_Config SHALL provide secure connection URLs for production deployments
4. WHERE the application runs in development mode, THE WebSocket_Manager SHALL support both WS and WSS protocols
5. THE Client_Application SHALL display clear error messages when connection security requirements are not met

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want environment-specific WebSocket configuration, so that connections work correctly across development, staging, and production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Environment_Config SHALL define WebSocket URLs based on deployment environment
2. WHEN deployed to production, THE WebSocket_Manager SHALL enforce secure connections only
3. THE Connection_Security_Handler SHALL validate WebSocket URLs before attempting connections
4. IF an insecure connection is attempted from HTTPS, THEN THE WebSocket_Manager SHALL automatically upgrade to WSS
5. THE Environment_Config SHALL support fallback connection strategies for different environments

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust connection error handling, so that users receive helpful feedback when WebSocket connections fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE WebSocket_Manager SHALL implement exponential backoff for failed connection attempts
2. WHEN Mixed Content Policy blocks a connection, THE Connection_Security_Handler SHALL log specific security violation details
3. THE Client_Application SHALL provide user-friendly error messages for connection failures
4. THE WebSocket_Manager SHALL attempt connection recovery with corrected protocols
5. WHERE authentication fails, THE Connection_Security_Handler SHALL distinguish between security and authentication errors
