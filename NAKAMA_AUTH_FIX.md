# Nakama Authentication Fix

## Issue Summary
Your Nakama client was failing to authenticate with 401 Unauthorized errors because both the client and server were using the insecure default server key `defaultkey`.

## What I've Fixed

### âœ… Client Configuration Updated
- Updated `client/.env.local` with a new secure 64-character server key
- The client now uses: `65fe2645baf246d6d30f425a6a891cfb0e7028684e4c816460e64a9c8e552e3f`

### ðŸ”„ Server Configuration (Railway) - Action Required
You need to set the same server key on your Railway deployment:

1. **Go to your Railway dashboard**
2. **Navigate to your Nakama service**
3. **Go to Variables/Environment tab**
4. **Add a new environment variable:**
   ```
   Variable Name: NAKAMA_SERVER_KEY
   Variable Value: 65fe2645baf246d6d30f425a6a891cfb0e7028684e4c816460e64a9c8e552e3f
   ```
5. **Redeploy your service**

## How the Fix Works

### Before (The Problem):
- **Client**: Used `defaultkey` (insecure)
- **Server**: Used `defaultkey` (insecure, rejected by security validation)
- **Result**: 401 Unauthorized errors

### After (The Solution):
- **Client**: Uses secure 64-character key
- **Server**: Uses the same secure key (when you set the Railway env var)
- **Result**: Successful authentication

## Server Configuration Details

Your Railway start script (`railway-start.sh`) uses this configuration:
```bash
--socket.server_key "${NAKAMA_SERVER_KEY:-defaultkey}"
```

This means:
- If `NAKAMA_SERVER_KEY` is set â†’ uses that value
- If `NAKAMA_SERVER_KEY` is not set â†’ falls back to `defaultkey`

By setting the Railway environment variable, you ensure the server uses the secure key.

## Testing the Fix

After setting the Railway environment variable and redeploying:

1. **Check the Railway logs** for confirmation:
   ```
   NAKAMA_SERVER_KEY: [should show as set, not "not set"]
   ```

2. **Test your client application** - the 401 errors should be resolved

3. **Monitor the console** - you should see successful authentication messages instead of errors

## Security Notes

- âœ… The new server key is cryptographically secure (32 random bytes = 64 hex characters)
- âœ… It's different from any default or common keys
- âœ… It's properly configured for production use

## Additional Environment Variables (Already Configured)

Your Railway deployment should also have these for optimal security:
- `NAKAMA_CONSOLE_USERNAME` (for admin access)
- `NAKAMA_CONSOLE_PASSWORD` (for admin access)

## Troubleshooting

If you still see 401 errors after setting the Railway variable:

1. **Verify the variable is set correctly** in Railway dashboard
2. **Check Railway deployment logs** for any startup errors
3. **Ensure the variable name is exactly**: `NAKAMA_SERVER_KEY`
4. **Verify the client is using the updated .env.local file**

## Next Steps

1. Set the `NAKAMA_SERVER_KEY` environment variable on Railway
2. Redeploy your Nakama service
3. Test your client application
4. Monitor for successful authentication

The fix should resolve your 401 Unauthorized errors and enable proper client-server communication.
